## HLD Generation Guidelines

- **Project Goal:** Migrate existing scripts to C code.
- **Target Platforms:** Multiple embedded platforms with low memory and low CPU resources.
- **Constraints:** Code must be efficient, lightweight, and platform-neutral to ensure portability across different embedded systems.

## Migration Strategy
1. **Requirements Gathering**
    - For scripts selected in context, create a Markdown (`.md`) file documenting:
        - Functional requirements
        - Inputs/outputs
        - Dependencies
        - Constraints (timing, memory, etc.)
        - Edge cases and error handling

2. **High Level Design (HLD)**
    - For each script, create a separate HLD `.md` file including:
        - Architecture overview
        - Module/component breakdown
        - Data flow diagrams or descriptions
        - Key algorithms and data structures
        - Interfaces and integration points

3. **Flowchart Creation**
   - Develop flowcharts to visually represent the script's logic and workflow.
   - Use `mermaid` syntax for creating flowcharts.
   - For environments that may have issues with complex Mermaid diagrams, include a simplified text-based flowchart alternative.
   - For scripts having related functionality, create combined or linked flowcharts to show interactions.
   - Use standard flowchart symbols for processes, decisions, inputs/outputs, and connectors.
   - Ensure flowcharts are clear, concise, and accurately reflect the script's functionality.
   - Include annotations or notes for complex logic or important details.
   - Store flowcharts in a dedicated directory within the project for easy reference.

4. **Fine tuning**
   - Do not create implementation roadmap markdown files.
   - Do not suggest timelines or planning details for execution.
