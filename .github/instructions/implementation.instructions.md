## Implementation Guidelines

- **Project Goal:** Migrate existing scripts to C code.
- **Target Platforms:** Multiple embedded platforms with low memory and low CPU resources.
- **Constraints:** Code must be efficient, lightweight, and platform-neutral to ensure portability across different embedded systems.

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Setup Development Environment**
    - Use docker containers for consistent build environments.
    - Container image that can be used for functional testing - https://github.com/rdkcentral/docker-device-mgt-service-test/pkgs/container/docker-device-mgt-service-test%2Fnative-platform

2. **Code Development**
    - Translate HLD components into modular C code.
    - Adhere to coding standards and best practices for embedded systems.
    - Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.
    - Optimize for memory usage and performance.
    - Do not use system calls to best possible extent.

3. **Code Review and Integration**
    - Conduct peer reviews to ensure code quality and adherence to design.
    - Integrate modules incrementally and perform integration testing.

4. **Documentation**
    - Update code comments and API documentation.
    - Document build and deployment procedures.
    - Provide examples and usage guidelines.
    - Maintain a changelog for implementation updates.

5. **Testing**
    - Develop unit tests for individual modules.
    - Perform system testing on target hardware or simulators.
    - Validate against original script functionality and performance criteria.
